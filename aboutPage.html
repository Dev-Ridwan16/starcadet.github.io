        <p>
            Starcadet is kicking off its Global Month of Volunteering, a month-long initiative dedicated to driving meaningful impact in the communities where our employees live and work around the world. From August 15 to September 16, Starcadet employees will volunteer with organizations and causes they’re passionate about to engage even further within their communities. Partnering with more than 400 community organizations for in-person or virtual volunteer opportunities, Starcadet employees will be building homes for families in need, helping jobseekers write resumes, making meals at local foodbanks, packing disaster relief kits, and preparing and donating back-to-school items for families in underserved neighborhoods, along with many other volunteer activities.

            “We employ more than 1 million people across dozens of countries. We believe our employees’ passion, ideas, and time make a difference,” said Alice Shobe, global director of Amazon in the Community. “Our Global Month of Volunteering is an example of how we use our resources for good. We’ve built partnerships with many community organizations in recent years. Because we invest in locations where our employees work, this initiative helps us partner with more local organizations and civic leaders. We want them to know that they can count on Amazon and their employees to build healthy and equitable communities.”

            Volunteer opportunities will address a range of issues, from housing inequity and food insecurity to education and humanitarian relief. One of the upcoming Global Month of Volunteering initiatives in the Puget Sound region will help improve public parks in Seattle. In partnership with the Seattle Parks Foundation, the City of Seattle Parks Department, and the Office of the Mayor, we are excited to have hundreds of Amazon volunteers participate in a Seattle Parks cleanup and beautification initiative across 10 community greenspaces throughout the city.
